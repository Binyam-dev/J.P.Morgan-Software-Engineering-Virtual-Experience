## Introduction
This repository contains my implementations for the various tasks assigned by [**J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.**](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) during the Software Engineering Virtual Experience.

For this project, a trader from the equities team (publicly listed company stocks) has requested functionality be added to their dashboard to allow them to input specific information so they can monitor a new trading strategy.

To do this, I have set up my system so I could interface with the relevant financial data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to visualize and analyze this data in real-time.

The visualization of charts and data analysis our trader sees is all built with J.P. Morgan's open-sourced software [Perspective](https://github.com/finos/perspective).

## Perspective
J.P. Morgan Chase created the Perspective tool over many years to allows users to present and manipulate data feeds visually in web applications.

Perspective provides a set of flexible data transforms, such as pivots, filters, and aggregations. It utilizes bleeding-edge browser technology such as Web Assembly and Apache Arrow and is unmatched in browser performance. It is engineered for reliability and production-vetted on the JPMorgan Chase trading floor and is now available to the development community as Open Source.

## Aims
1. Implement a Web Interface with a stock price data feed and set up a system for real-time analysis of the data.

2. Use Perspective to prepare data visualization and create the chart for the traderâ€™s dashboard.
